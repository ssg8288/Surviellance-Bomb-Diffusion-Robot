# Arduino uno

This micro controller (ATMega 328 for Arduino Uno model) based circuit board has a crystal of 16 MHz is used as the clock frequency generator.
* Flash mem of 32k bytes (of which .5k is used for the bootloader),
* SRAM   2k bytes,
* EEPROM 1k byte

# MI Camera

It has a 1080 FHD vision with 360degree rotation, Infrared night vision, motion detect talkback feature enables to interact both the sides, supports SD card 64 gb, live streaming works on Wi-Fi. This we will monitor using MI home app over cellphone screen.

#	Flex Sensor

A flex sensor or bend sensor is a sensor that measures the amount of deflection or bending. Usually, the sensor is stuck to the surface, and resistance of sensor element is varied by bending the surface. Since the resistance is directly proportional to the amount of bend it is used as goniometer, and often called flexible potentiometer.

# MPU 6050

The MPU6050 is a Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which consists of a 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope inside it. This helps us to measure acceleration, velocity, orientation, displacement and many other motion related parameter of a system or object.

#	Servo Motor

A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism.

#	Motor

* Base Motor RPM: 18000
* Operating Voltage: 6-18 v
* Rated Voltage: 12 V
* Rated Torque: 56.1 N-cm
* Stall Torque: 350 N-cm
* Gearbox Dimensions: 25×37 (LxW) mm
* RPM: 200 rpm

# NRF24L01

nRF24L01 is a single chip radio transceiver for the world wide 2.4 - 2.5 GHz ISM band. The transceiver consists of a fully integrated frequency synthesizer, a power amplifier, a crystal oscillator, a demodulator, modulator and Enhanced ShockBurst™ protocol engine. Output power, frequency channels, and protocol setup are easily programmable through a SPI interface. Current consumption is very low, only 9.0mA at an output power of -6dBm and 12.3mA in RX mode. Built-in Power Down and Standby modes makes power saving easily realizable..

# Arduino nano

The Arduino Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3.x). It has more or less the same functionality of the Arduino Duemilanove, but in a different package. It lacks only a DC power jack, and works with a Mini-B USB cable instead of a standard one.
