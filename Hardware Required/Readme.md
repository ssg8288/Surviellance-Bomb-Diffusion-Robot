# Arduino uno

This micro controller (ATMega 328 for Arduino Uno model) based circuit board has a crystal of 16 MHz is used as the clock frequency generator.
* Flash mem of 32k bytes (of which .5k is used for the bootloader),
* SRAM   2k bytes,
* EEPROM 1k byte

# MI Camera

It has a 1080 FHD vision with 360degree rotation, Infrared night vision, motion detect talkback feature enables to interact both the sides, supports SD card 64 gb, live streaming works on Wi-Fi. This we will monitor using MI home app over cellphone screen.

#	Flex Sensor

A flex sensor or bend sensor is a sensor that measures the amount of deflection or bending. Usually, the sensor is stuck to the surface, and resistance of sensor element is varied by bending the surface. Since the resistance is directly proportional to the amount of bend it is used as goniometer, and often called flexible potentiometer.

# MPU 6050

The MPU6050 is a Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which consists of a 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope inside it. This helps us to measure acceleration, velocity, orientation, displacement and many other motion related parameter of a system or object.

#	Servo Motor

A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism.

#	Motor

* Base Motor RPM: 18000
* Operating Voltage: 6-18 v
* Rated Voltage: 12 V
* Rated Torque: 56.1 N-cm
* Stall Torque: 350 N-cm
* Gearbox Dimensions: 25×37 (LxW) mm
* RPM: 200 rpm

# NRF24L01

nRF24L01 is a single chip radio transceiver for the world wide 2.4 - 2.5 GHz ISM band. The transceiver consists of a fully integrated frequency synthesizer, a power amplifier, a crystal oscillator, a demodulator, modulator and Enhanced ShockBurst™ protocol engine. Output power, frequency channels, and protocol setup are easily programmable through a SPI interface. Current consumption is very low, only 9.0mA at an output power of -6dBm and 12.3mA in RX mode. Built-in Power Down and Standby modes makes power saving easily realizable..

# Arduino nano

The Arduino Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3.x). It has more or less the same functionality of the Arduino Duemilanove, but in a different package. It lacks only a DC power jack, and works with a Mini-B USB cable instead of a standard one.

# Arduino Mega 2560 R3

The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Mega 2560 board is compatible with most shields designed for the Uno and the former boards Duemilanove or Diecimila.
The Mega 2560 is an update to the Arduino Mega, which it replaces.![Read](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3)

# Arduino Mega 2560 R3 Sensor Shield 

Arduino Mega 2560 R3 Sensor Shield V2.0 has an advantage of a PCB Immersion Gold processed all of the digital and analog interfaces, the motherboard will not only be extended to the steering gear line order form ad hoc Bluetooth module communication interface, SD card module communication interface, APC220 radio frequency module communication interface, and RB URF v1.1 ultrasonic sensor interface, and independent expansion easier to use convenient. beginner, do not have cumbersome complex circuit connection and headache, will simplify the circuit on the true meaning of this sensor expansion board can easily connect the commonly used sensor, a sensor only needs a universal 3P sensor cable (regardless of digital cable and analog cable), complete the circuit connection, write the program is downloaded to the MEGA controller reads the sensor data, or receive wireless module return data, operation processing, final Easily complete your own interactive works. ![Read](https://robu.in/product/arduino-mega-2560-r3-sensor-shield-v2-0/)
